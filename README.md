# Transfer-Learning-Model

## Hi üòÉ

In this repository I have made a Image classification model with the help of Xception Transfer learning Model.

The Xception Model is pre-trained on Imagenet database.

Basically ImageNet is a project intended to label and categorize Images manually. in the field of Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks, we will refer ImageNet as ‚ÄúImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge‚Äù in short ILSVRC.
The main objective of this ImageNet project is to train a model, which can classify an Input Image into 1000 separate object categories.
Categories include species of dogs, cats, fish, Vehicle types include vehicle parts like wheels, steering, etc to know more Categories refer
The models are trained on approximately 1.2 million Images and additional 50000 images for validation and 100,000 images for testing.

After the model implementation I made a flask application to deployed my model on a local server to predict the category of the image.
